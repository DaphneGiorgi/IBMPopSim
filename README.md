IBMPopSim
=========

The IBMPopSim R package is conceived to simulate the random evolution of structured population dynamics, called stochastic Individual Based Models (IBMs).

The package allows users to simulate the random evolution of  a population in which  individuals are characterised by their date of birth, a set of (discrete or continuous) attributes, and their potential date of death.
The population is modified due to different types of events  defined by the user, and occuring at random dates. These events include the birth/arrival or death/exit of an individual in the population, an individual changing caracteristics, or custom events defined by the user.
Once the events modifiying the population have been defined, the last step before simulating the population evolution is to specify the so-called events intensities, describing the frequency at which the different types of events occur in the population.
