This vignette provides an example  of usage of the package IBMPopSim, for simulating an heterogeneous life insurance portfolio.

See `vignette('IBMPopSim')` for a detailed presentation of the package.

# Example description

We consider a insurance portfolio composed of males policyholders, characterized by their age and risk class (for instance smokers vs non smokers).

Entries to the portfolio are modeled by Poissonian events, and individuals can die or exit the portfolio with an intensity depending on their age and risk class.


# Population creation


We start with an initial population of 10 000 males of age 65, distributed uniformly in each risk class.

The population data frame has thus the two (mandatory) columns:
- `birth` : Date of birth of the policyholders (here the initial time is $t_0=0$).
- `death`: Date of death (`NA` if alive).

and the column `risk_cls` corresponding to the policyholders risk class.

```{r}
N <- 30000
pop_df <- data.frame("birth"=rep(-65,N),"death"=rep(NA,N),"risk_cls"= rep(1:2,each= N/2))
```

# Model parameters


## Death intensity

Death intensities are calibrated on England and Wales (EW) males mortality data (source: Human Mortality Database), and forecasted over t=30 years by a Lee-Carter model with the package `StMoMo`.
Individuals in the  risk class 1 are assumed to have  mortality rates 20% higher that the forecasted mortality  rates and individuals in the risk class 2 are assumed to have  mortality rates 20% lower than the forecasted rates. The death intensity of a individual in risk class $i=1,2$ is thus the function

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:deathrates) d^i(t,a)= \alpha_i \sum_{k=0}^{29}\mathbf{1}_{\{k\leq t < k+1\}} d_k(a), \quad \alpha_1 = 1.2, \quad \alpha_2 = 0.8,
\end{equation}

and where $d_k(a)$ is the point estimate of the mortality rate for age $a$ and  year $2017 + k$.

```{r}
EWStMoMoMale <- StMoMoData(EWdata_hmd, series = "male")

#Fitting
LC <- lc()
ages.fit <- 65:100
years.fit <- 1950:2016
LCfitMale <- fit(LC, data = EWStMoMoMale, ages.fit = ages.fit, years.fit = years.fit)

```

```{r, insur_forecast}
t <- 30
LCforecastMale <- forecast(LCfitMale, h = t)
plot(LCforecastMale)
```

Age and time dependent function can be created with the package function `?piecewise_xy`, with allows to define age-specific mortality rates, piecewise constant in time, such as $d^i$ in \@ref(eq:deathrates).

```{r}
d_k <- apply(LCforecastMale$rates, 2, function(x) stepfun(66:100, x))
breaks <- 1:29
death_male <- piecewise_xy(breaks,d_k)
```

```{r}
death_male(10,65) # Death rate at time t=10 (years 2027) and age 60.
```

```{r}
params <- list("death_male" = death_male, "alpha" = c(1.3,0.8))
```

## Exit events


Individuals exit the portfolio at a rate $\mu^{i}$, $i=1,2$ depending on their risk class.

```{r}
params$mu <- c(0.001,0.06) # Exit event rate
```

## Entry  events


Entry events occur at a Poissonian (constant) rate $\lambda$ (in average $\lambda$ individuals enter the population each year).


```{r}
params$lambda <- 30000 # Entry events
```

# Events creation


## Death events creation

The vector parameter `alpha` will be  transformed into a C++ vector (with index starting at 0) during the model creation, and `death_male` into a C++ function.

```{r}
death_event <- mk_event_individual(
    type = "death",
    intensity_code = "result = alpha[I.risk_cls-1] * death_male(t,age(I, t));"
)
```

## Exit events creation

Each individual in the portfolio can  exit the portfolio at a constant (individual) rate $\mu^i$ depending on their risk class.

In the presence of events of type `exit` in the population, a characteristic named `out` is automatically added to the individuals characteristics, set to `FALSE` by default.
When an individual leaves the population, his characteristic `out` is set to `TRUE` and the date at which he exited the population is recorded in the column `death`.

```{r}
exit_event <- mk_event_individual(
    type = "exit",
    intensity = "result = mu[I.risk_cls-1]; "
)
```

## Entry event creation


New policyholders enter the population at a constant rate $\lambda$ (on average, $\lambda$ individuals enter the portfolio each year). A new individual entering the population at age $a$ given by a uniform variable on $[65,70]$, and  is in risk class 1 with probability $p$.

In the presence of events of type `entry` in the population, a characteristic named `entry` is automatically added to the individuals characteristics, set to `NA` by default.
When an individual leaves the population, his characteristic `entry` is set to the date $t$ at which he enters the population.

```{r}
params$p <- 0.5
```

```{r}
entry_event <- mk_event_poisson(
    type = "entry",
    intensity = "lambda",
    kernel_code = "if (CUnif()<p)
                        newI.risk_cls =1;
                   else
                        newI.risk_cls= 2;
                   double a = CUnif(65,70);
                   newI.set_age(a,t);"
)
```

<!--```{remark}-->
Note that entries can also occur at a rate $\lambda(t)$ depending on time. For more details, see documentation of `?mk_event_poisson_inhomogeneous`.
<!--```-->

# Model creation

```{r}
model <- mk_model(
    characteristics = get_characteristics(pop_df),# Characteristics names ant type
    events = list(death_event,entry_event, exit_event), # Events list
    parameters = params # Model parameters
)
summary(model)
```

# Simulation


## Computation of event intensity bounds

For events with Poisson (constant) intensity, the bound is simply the intensity.

```{r}
death_max <- max(sapply(d_k, function(x) { max(x) }))
```

## Simulation

```{r}
sim_out <- popsim(model = model,
    population =pop_df,
    events_bounds = c('death' = death_max, "entry"=params$lambda, "exit"=max(params$mu)),
    parameters = params,
    time = t,
    age_max = 110,
    multithreading = TRUE)
```

**Ratio of accepted events**

```{r}
sim_out$logs[["effective_events"]] / sim_out$logs[["proposed_events"]]
```

# Outputs

Data frame `sim_out$population` is composed of all individuals present in the portfolio over the period $[0, t]$ (individuals in the initial population and who entered the portfolio). Each line corresponds to an individual, with his date of birth, date of death (`NA` if still alive at the end of the simulation), risk class, and the characteristic `out`.
The characteristics `out` is set to `TRUE` for individuals who left the portfolio due to an exit event.

```{r}
str(sim_out$population)
```

The function `?age_pyramid`computes the age pyramid of a population data frame at a given time.


## Age pyramids

```{r, insur_pyramid}
age_grp <- 65:98
pyr = age_pyramid(sim_out$population, time = 30, ages=age_grp)
plot_pyramid(pyr, age_breaks = as.integer(seq(1,length(age_grp)-1,by=2)))
```

In order to visualize both risk classes on the same age pyramid with `?plot_pyramid` a column `group_name` containing the individuals risk classes must be added to the age pyramid, and the colors representing each subgroup have to be specified.

```{r, insur_pyr_group}
colnames(pyr)[2]<- "group_name"
pyr$group_name <- as.character(pyr$group_name)
colors <- c("1"="#00AFBB","2"="#FC4E07")
plot_pyramid(pyr,colors,age_breaks = as.integer(seq(1,length(age_grp)-1,by=2)))
```

## Life tables

Death and exposure tables can be computed from the simulation, taking into account the censoring due to exit events.
Note that when individuals enter the population at different ages, the package functions `?death_table` and `?exposure_table`do not take into account this right censoring.


###  Risk class 1

Death and exposure data can be computed from the simulated portfolio. Below is an example with individuals in risk class 1. A Lee-Carter model is reestimated from the simulated data, and compare with the initial forecast.

```{r}
age_grp <- 65:95
```

```{r}
Dx <- death_table(sim_out$population[sim_out$population$risk_cls==1,],
                  ages = age_grp, period = 0:30)
Ex <- exposure_table(sim_out$population[sim_out$population$risk_cls==1,],
                     ages = age_grp, period = 0:30)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
LC <- lc()
LCfitSim1 <- fit(LC, Dxt = Dx , Ext = Ex,ages=age_grp[-length(age_grp)])
```

```{r, insur_LeeCarter_risk1}
time <- 30
plot(age_grp[-length(age_grp)],
     LCfitSim1$ax + LCfitSim1$bx*LCfitSim1$kt[t],
     col="red", main ="Log mortality rates in risk class 1 at t=30",
     xlab = "age", ylab="log mortality rates")
lines(age_grp[-length(age_grp)],
      log(1.3*LCforecastMale$rates[1:(length(age_grp)-1),t]),
      col="blue")
legend(x="bottomrigh", legend=c("Estimated mortality rates", "Point forecast"),
       col=c("red", "blue"),lty=c(NA,1),pch=c(1,NA))
```

### Global portofolio

Due to the mortality differential between risk class 1 and 2, there should be more individuals in risk class 2 at higher ages.
However, due to exit events, more individuals in risk class 1 one exit the portfolio over time, leading to a higher proportion of individuals in risk class 1 at higher ages than expected when there are no exit events. Thus, mortality rates are closer to mortality rates in risk class 1 at higher ages.

**Computation of central mortality rates**

```{r}
Dx_pop <- death_table(sim_out$population, ages = age_grp, period = 0:30)
Ex_pop <- exposure_table(sim_out$population, ages = age_grp, period = 0:30)
mx_pop <- Dx_pop/Ex_pop
```

```{r, insur_mortality_rates}
time <- 30
plot(age_grp[-length(age_grp)], log((Dx_pop/Ex_pop)[,time]),
     main = "Portfolio log mortality rates at t=30",
     xlab = "age", ylab = "log mortality rates")
lines(age_grp[-length(age_grp)],
      log(1.3*LCforecastMale$rates[1:(length(age_grp)-1),time]),
      col = "#00AFBB")
lines(age_grp[-length(age_grp)],
      log(0.8*LCforecastMale$rates[1:(length(age_grp)-1),time]),
      col = "#FC4E07")
legend(x="bottomrigh", legend=c("Portfolio", "Risk class 1","Risk class 2"),
       col=c("black","#00AFBB","#FC4E07"), lty=c(NA,1,1), pch=c(1,NA,NA))
```

**Evolution of portfolio mortality rates over time**

The decrease in mortality rates is slower in the portfolio than in the global population due to composition changes.

```{r, insur_evol_mortality}
matplot(age_grp[-length(age_grp)],log(mx_pop),
        type='l', xlab = "age", ylab = "log mortality rates")
```

**Cohort mortality rates**

```{r, insur_cohort}
plot(65:94,log(extractCohort(mx_pop, age= 65, period =0)), type="l")
lines(65:89,log(extractCohort(mx_pop, age= 65, period =5)), col = "#00AFBB")
lines(65:84,log(extractCohort(mx_pop, age= 65, period =10)), col="#FC4E07")
legend(x="bottomrigh",
       legend=c("Initial cohort", "Age 65 at t=5","Age 65 at t=10"),
       col=c("black","#00AFBB","#FC4E07"), lty=c(1,1,1))
```

# Different simulations with the same model

The initial population and model parameters can be modified without have to recompile the model, in order to simulate the population model with different input. The event bounds must be modified accordingly before running again the simulation.

A event can also be deactivated by setting the event bound to 0.

See `vignette('IBMPopSim_human_pop')` for several examples.
